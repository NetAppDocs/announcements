We've made it easier for you to view syntax for the most popular languages by adding highlighting.

For example, here's syntax for obtaining a user token from NetApp Cloud Central:

[source,http]
POST https://netapp-cloud-account.auth0.com/oauth/token
Header: Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
              "username": "<user_email>",
              "scope": "profile",
              "audience": "https://api.cloud.netapp.com",
              "client_id": "UaVhOIXMWQs5i1WdDxauXe5Mqkb34NJQ",
              "grant_type": "password",
              "password": "<user_password>"
}

As you can see, we've also added a Copy button to make it easy for you to copy the syntax to your clipboard.

Here's another example that shows JSON output:

[source,json]
[
    {
        "header": {
            "requestId": "init",
            "clientId": "init",
            "agentId": "init"
        },
        "payload": {
            "init": {}
        },
        "id": "5801"
    }
]

We hope that you find this enhancement helpful!
