If you'd like to request changes to the docs and you'd rather not edit the source content directly, you can now provide feedback by clicking *Request doc changes*.

This new button appears at the top of each page:

When you click *Request doc changes*, you're prompted to create or sign in to your GitHub account (it's free and easy to create an account).

After you log in, a form to create a new GitHub issue appears. The text box is prepopulated with the title and URL of the page. Don't delete this information--it helps us identify the page where you found the issue.

Provide details in the text box, and then click *Submit new issue* to create an issue for your request.

Weâ€™ll review your feedback and take it from there.
