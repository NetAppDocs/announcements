We've listened to your feedback and added the ability to download PDFs right from our HTML docs. This makes it easy for you to take our content on the go.

You can download a PDF in a few different ways.

The first way is to download a PDF of the page that you're currently viewing.

More options are available above the table of the contents on the left. Click *Download PDF* and you'll see options to generate a PDF of the entire doc site, the entire section (if the section has multiple pages), or just the page that you're viewing.

We're still working on this functionality, so consider "download a PDF" as a BETA feature for now. There are a few known issues, such as links within the PDF pointing back to HTML pages.

It's also important to note that we're constantly updating and improving our content, so you'll want to use these PDFs for short intervals. For example, they're helpful if you're going on a plane ride or if you're going to a secure location where internet isn't available. You shouldn't download a PDF and refer to that same PDF months later--there's a very good chance that it will be out of date. Be sure to download the latest content.
