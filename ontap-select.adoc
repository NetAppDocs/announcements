We recently added content for ONTAP Select to our GitHub authoring platform. The content can help you with ONTAP Select running on VMware ESXi, as well as the hypervisor-independent documentation (such as the REST API).

We're excited about this change because the content authoring team combined content from multiple sources into one searchable online library.

Take a look and contribute to this new documentation experience for ONTAP Select. You can edit, request a change, or even send feedback. Go to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-select/index.html[ONTAP Select documentation] to get started.
