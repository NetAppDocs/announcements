We've updated our http://docs.netapp.com/contribute/us-en/index.html[Contributor's guide^] to cover style and syntax for NetApp Docs stored in GitHub.

We started storing some of our content in GitHub for several reasons. One important reason was to enable contributions from our community. NetApp docs are better because of feedback from you--our customers, partners, and NetApp employees.

One way to provide feedback is by editing the source content that's stored in GitHub:

To help you submit content updates, we added the following to our http://docs.netapp.com/contribute/us-en/index.html[Contributor's guide^]:

Style guide for NetApp docs:: Follow this lightweight guide to understand the style of NetApp docs: conversational and empathetic, but to the point.

AsciiDoc reference:: Follow this reference to learn AsciiDoc syntax, which is a lightweight markup language, similar to Markdown.

We hope that you find these resources helpful and take part in contributing to NetApp documentation. If you'd rather not edit the source content directly, you can still provide your feedback by clicking *Request doc changes*. We'll review your feedback and take it from there.

Happy contributing!
