Documentation for NetApp's new Cloud Tiering service is now available on https://docs.netapp.com[docs.netapp.com^].

Based on NetApp FabricPool technology, Cloud Tiering identifies infrequently-used data in your ONTAP clusters and automatically and seamlessly moves that data to low-cost object storage in the cloud.

Go to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-tiering/[Cloud Tiering documentation^] to learn how to get started.
