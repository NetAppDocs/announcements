Now that ONTAP 9.7 is Generally Available, we wanted to announce that we added redesigned content for ONTAP System Manager to docs.netapp.com.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, a totally redesigned ONTAP System Manager simplifies ONTAP management with an intuitive graphical user interface. The new dashboard shows key cluster status and performance on one screen.

The documentation for ONTAP System Manager is totally redesigned as well. Easy-to-navigate content is quick and easy to use. Watch embedded videos for quick overviews of major management tasks.

Go to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/index.html[ONTAP System Manager documentation] to get started.
