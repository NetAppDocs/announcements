Each page in the docs now includes the GitHub avatars of people who contributed to the page. This change supports our goal of making NetApp Docs community driven.

You'll see the GitHub avatar for anyone who committed a change to the source content by creating a pull request. The contributor can be a customer, NetApp partner, or employee. Here's an example:

Whether you're an expert or a novice, submit changes to the content and you'll get notoriety for your contribution.

Note that the avatars are small enough that you won't be overwhelmed by the faces of NetApp writers each time you look at the docs pass:[&#128521;]
